2015-Strategic-Plan (Super Rough Draft)
===================

Our plan for 2015.

Group Description (Under Construction)

This is who we are as a group.


Here is what we want to get done this year.
- Increase collaboration with other brigades.
- Increase community outreach: booths at events, collaboration with non-profits, hold hack nights in surrounding areas (Roseville, Lincoln, etc).
- Increase member engagement: occasional "night out"/"beer night".

Here is how we’re going to get there.
- Host a hackathon with other brigades in the region.
- Crash other brigades' meetups.

Here are what outcomes we’ll see if we’re successful.
