##What We Want to Do This Year
_Our strategy needs to map to one or more of the [Code for America Principles for 21st Century Governments](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/)._
- Increase collaboration with other brigades. (CfA principles 5, 6, and 7)
- Increase community outreach: booths at events, collaboration with non-profits, hold hack nights in surrounding areas (Roseville, Lincoln, etc), Davis Roots. (CfA principles 1 and 2)
- Increase member engagement: occasional "night out"/"beer night". (CfA principles 1 and 2)

### Strategy and Tactics
_Here is how weâ€™re going to do it:_
- Host a hackathon with other brigades in the region.
- Crash other brigades' meetups.
- Actionable item for government (Robert, do these make sense?):
    Standards for applications that could be adopted/deployed by government partners
      Security
      Explicit pipeline i.e. Code 4 Sac -> Robert -> Legal -> Copywriters -> Deployment
      Funding and long-term support
- 15-30 minute hands-on workshops that teach very specific skills -> repeat every 2-3 months (so 5 or so standard lessons; OR lessons recorded and put online) 
- Schools
    Univeristies
     Departments: Art and graphics; Computer Science; Public Health; Urban Architecture
      UCD: Child Family Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneuership; 
      Sac City:
      Sac State:
