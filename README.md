##Strategy and Tactics
_Here is how weâ€™re going to do it:_
###Collaboration

####With community organizations
- Solicit needs and pitches from local community organizations.
- Offer common-sense tech-oriented demos or talks to interested partners.

####With government partners
- Invite our municipal sponsor and any interested members of their team to attend a meetup.
- Promote open data policies at the state and local level.

####With regional brigades
- Host a hackathon with other brigades in the regions.
- Collaborate on a regional project for [Code Across](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/).
- Crash other brigades' meetups.

###Outreach
- Invite community organization representatives to deliver lightning talks at meetups.
- Promote a network effect with partners by boosting their work on our social and publishing platforms (and politely asking that they do the same for us).
- Investigate hosting booths at community events. (TODO: What type of events?)
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other other civic tech organizations, such as Girls Who Code.
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other meetups and tech/design/data organizations (especially campus-based organizations).
- Invite community organizations to pitch their needs at meetups.
- Hold demo meetups in surrounding areas (Roseville, Lincoln, etc), Davis Roots.

###Engagement
- Core team rotates responsibility for either bringing in a speaker, giving a talk, or having some other presentation.
- At Wednesday meetups, focus on collaboration: lightning talks, pitches and standups, encourage remote collaboration.
- Move Wednesday meetups back to 7:00 pm to allow people time to get off work.
- Hold monthly Second-Saturday hack days (Urban Hive?) (TODO: times? provide lunch?)
- Hold core team check-ins fifteen minutes before Wednesday meetings, and one hour core team meetings before hack days.
- Conduct regular surveys about satisfaction with hack nights and events
- Hold a quarterly Code for Sac open house. This event will replace that week's hack night.
- Reach out to local businesses (brewers, restaurants, etc.) about providing food sponsorship for events, because well-fed contributors are happier contributors.
